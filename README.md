## Placing Rectangles
#### First, Click anywhere to set the position of Top Center corner (Position).
#### Next, Click below the first point to set the Bottom Center corner (Height).
#### After that, Click to the left of the first point to set the Left Side (Left Length).
#### Finally, Click to the right of the first point to set the Right Side (Right Length).
<br>

## Keyboard
#### Press 'escape' to undo a corner or rectangle. **Bug:** Undoes the top layer, not the last layer added.
#### Use the arrow keys to move the view up and down.
#### Press 'd' to toggle dark mode.
<br>

## Side Panel
#### The side panel shows all of the rectangles' colors. (Some better way of telling the rectangles apart is needed).
#### Change the draw order of the rectangles by clicking the arrows on that rectangle's panel.
